1. Eligibility and Accounts
- You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may only use the Service with a parent or legal guardian’s consent.
- To access certain features, you must create an account using a username and password (email is optional) or by using a supported third‑party sign‑in provider such as Discord, Apple, or Google. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activities under your account.
- You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date. We may suspend or terminate your account if information is inaccurate, misleading, or if you violate these Terms.

2. The Service
- Moltly is a logbook for tarantula keepers to record molts, feedings, notes, reminders, and related photos.
- “Guest mode” stores your data only in your browser’s local storage and does not sync to our servers. If you clear your browser storage, that guest data will be lost and cannot be recovered by us.
- When signed in, your entries, research notes, reminders, and photo attachments are stored on our servers and associated with your account.

3. Your Content
- You retain ownership of the content you submit to the Service (including entries, notes, tags, and attachments).
- You grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, store, reproduce, process, and display your content solely as necessary to operate, maintain, and provide the Service and related features (e.g., backups, content delivery, and rendering in the app).

- Content delivery and security: We use Cloudflare as a reverse proxy, content delivery network (CDN), DNS, and security provider (including DDoS protection and web application firewall).

6a. Cookies and Security Technologies
- The Service uses strictly necessary security technologies provided by our infrastructure partners. In particular, Cloudflare may set essential cookies or local storage entries (for example, to distinguish bots from legitimate traffic or to maintain access after a challenge). These are necessary to deliver the Service securely and cannot be turned off.

7. Modifications and Availability
- We may add, remove, or change features at any time, and we may suspend or discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, with or without notice.
- We are not liable for any unavailability, delays, or failures caused by maintenance, outages, or events beyond our reasonable control.
